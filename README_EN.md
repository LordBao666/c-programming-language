This is a repository about my C programming learning journey. The meanings of each directory are as follow:

TheC：TheC directory aims to record essential code from the well-known book ，widely praised as  The  Bible of  C,  The C Programming Language. The subdirectories under the TheC folder correspond to each chapter in the book, and each  subdirectory includes two folder called content and ex. The content folder's contents are important code from the book  and the ex folder ‘s contents are the exercises. PS: I have already given up learning this material due to time constraint.
